                <li>SplitHorz1: Used in games which have split horizontal screen (Gran Turismo 2...)</li>
                <li>SplitHorz2: The same as SplitHorz1, but with the pads swapped</li>
            </ul>
            </p>
            <p id="cata3.5" >3.5. Emulator Preferences.
            </p>
            <p>Basically you need to configure the bios, input, cpu and
                sound options.
            </p>
            <p>3.5.1. Configuring the bios.
            </p>
            <p>Bios file. In the combo file selector, you can see the files
                which are on sdcard, select the BIOS you want to use. During testing we found
                that the scph1001.bin and scph7502.bin BIOS are compatible, but the scph1000.bin
                won't work. Please remember you may only be in possession of the copyrighted BIOS
                when you're legally entitled.
            </p>
            <p>Simulated/HLE Bios: From 1.9.21 ePSXe include a HLE bios, if you enable this option you
                do not need to use a bios to play (Compatibility is limited).
            </p>
            <p>3.5.2. Configuring the cpu.
            </p>
            <p>Cpu frame skip. It will speed up the emulator, but the video frame rate will
                be lower. It uses a experimental mode, which has been tested only in some games. You
                can choose "disabled", "enabled", or "enabled only in high resolution games".
            </p>
            <p>Show FPS. If you want to see the number of frame per second on gameplay, enable
                this option.
            </p>
            <p>Set Custom FPS. If you want to select the frames per second. You will get sound glitches.
            </p>
            <p>MME Enable. Enable/Disable/Force multimedia extension. With MME enabled it should be
                faster, but could be less accurate in some cases. Don't force in devices without neon
                support, or it will crash!</p>
            <p>Gte Precission. 32/64 Bits. It will be very accurate in 64bits and faster in 32 bits</p>
            <p>3.5.3. Configuring the screen.
            </p>
            <p>Screen orientation. You can choose landscape, portrait, or reverse landscape
                screen orientation.
            </p>
            <p>Screen ratio. You can choose stretch, 4:3 ratio or widescreen (Widescreen is a internal
                hack and it could be wrong in some games).
            </p>
            <p>Screen color depth. You can choose 16 or 32 bits. With 32 bits you will get better
                mdec colors.
            </p>
            <p>Top/bottoms black bands. You can remove the top/bottom black bands in the games,
                getting more bigger image, but it can break some games (like Alundra 2).
            </p>
            <p>VR Modes. Used to play the emulator with a cardboard. Not enable this modes when not
                using a cardboard or the screen will be drawn 2 times.
            </p>
            <p>3.5.4. Configuring the video.
            </p>
            <p>Video Renderer. You can select Hardware, Hardware + shaders, Software renderer or
                OpenGL Plugin. In general you should choose the Hardware renderer (faster and
                smoother graphics). Use the software renderer only in old devices (for example
                with GPU Adreno 200).  From the version 1.8.0, you can use a external OpenGL Plugin,
                which gets HI-RES graphics, but in general worse performance and glitches
                (see GPU Plugin below 3.10).
            </p>
            <p>Internal Resolution. You can choose x1/x2. x1 is accurate, x2 will increase resolution
                x2, it is smother, but it requires a very powerful CPU and it can create artifacts mainly
                in 2D games.
            </p>
            <p>Video Filtering. You can enable/disable the filtering in the hw/plugin opengl renderer.
            </p>
            <p>Filter for 2D games. You can enable filters for 2D games (2xsai and xbrz), but it is
                not compatible with increasing internal resolution x2/x4 and it is just for 2D games.
            </p>
            <p>HW/Soft Threading Mode. There are 2 modes, no-threading the most accurated, and
                2-thread faster in dual/quad core low end devices.
            </p>
            <p>Overscan top/Bottom. It emulates the overscan in old TVs. You can select the number
                of lines.
            </p>
            <p>Brightness Profile. The brightness can be increased using this resolution, interesting
                in dark games.
            </p>
            <p>GPU Shader. From the version 2.0 shaders are supported. You can select the shader in this
                section. Warning: it requires a very fast phone.
            </p>
            <p>GPU Plugin. If you want to use external OpenGL Plugin, you have to download the
                plugin from http://www.epsxe.com/files/libopenglpluginv12.so (for arm) or
                http://www.epsxe.com/files/libopenglpluginv12_intel.so (for intel atom), copy in your
                sdcard and choose it with this option. If you do not have this file, it falls down
                to the Hardware renderer. More info below.
            </p>
            <p>Plugin Reduce Internal Resolution. You can reduce the internal resolution from the
                GPU plugin. (Interesing in devices as Ouya).
            </p>
            <p>Plugin Texture Mode. It will use a different texture size, required to speed up
                the opengl plugin in Adreno 3XX cards.
            </p>
            <p>Plugin Threading Mode. You can choose "none", 2-threads, 2-threads+effects,
                2-threads+most effects. If you have a fast phone with 2 or 4 cores, you can enable
                the 2-threads mode to speed up or add extra effects as final fantasy series swirls.
            </p>
            <p>Common options:</p>
            <p>Plugin Subpixel precision. Less shaking and better polygon precision, but a fast
                cpu is required.
            </p>
            <p>PSX dithering. Enable/Disable the PSX dithering pattern.
            </p>
            <p>Scanlines. Enable/Disable the scanlines and select thickness and transparency leve.
            </p>
            <p>3.5.5. Configuring the sound.
            </p>
            <p>Sound quality. In ePSXe, you can enable or disable the audio ouput. Disabling
                the audio will speed up emulation but some games could stop working. High quality
                have more sounds effects (interpolation and reverb), but more cpu is required.
            </p>
            <p>Sound latency. You can use the normal latency mode, avaliable from the first
                version, the low latency mode (experimental - frecuency is adjusted to
                emulation speed, but you need 100% fps to get good sound), or the new low latency
                mode 2, which doesn't adjust the frecuency.
            </p>
            <p>3.5.6. Configuring the input
            </p>
            <p>Numbers of players. ePSXe supports 1/2 Players mode, 1 a fun 2 players mode for tablets (using split screen mode), and 4 players support (in games supported multitap).

            <p id="cata3.6" >3.6. Memory cards support.
            </p>
            <p>ePSXe also comes with memory card support. The virtual cards are saved
                as 2 files in your \memcards directory. The first one is named epsxe000.mcr
                and the second one epsxe001.mcr. Each file has a size of 128 KB (which is
                PSX standard), and the format is simply a dump of real memory cards.
            </p>
            <p>ePSXe doesn't come with a memory card editor, or card selector for Android,
                but you can easily change the memcards manually by moving files in your sdcard.
            </p>
            <p>ePSXe also has support for different memory card
                file supports, like Dexdrive (.gme), PSEmu Pro (.mc) and several others.
            </p>
            <p id="cata3.7" >3.7. Savestates.
            </p>
            <p>ePSXe supports savestates. They are files that
                contain the state of the emulator when the key was hit, so you
                can restore the emulation later in that same exact point.
            </p>
            <p>Menu-Savestate = Save the state to the slot selected
                (MAX = 5 slots)<br/>
                Menu-Loadstate = Load the state of the slot selected
            </p>
            <p>ePSXe 1.2.0, 1.4.0 supports savestates version 0.<br/>
                ePSXe 1.5.0      supports savestates version 0 and 1.<br/>
                ePSXe 1.6.0      supports savestates version 0, 1 and 2.<br/>
                ePSXe 1.7.0      supports savestates version 0, 1, 2 and 3.<br/>
                ePSXe &gt;=1.8.0      supports savestates version 0, 1, 2 and 3.
            </p>
            <p> Of course you can use savestates from PC on Android version, and vice versa. </p>
            <p id="cata3.8" >3.8. SBI files.
            </p>
            <p>
                Now you can use SBI files for subchannel reading (required in some PAL games).<br/>
                1) Get the SBI for your game in:
                http://psxdatacenter.com/sbifiles.html or http://redump.org<br/>
                2) Copy your subchannel file in the same folder as your iso, with the same name,
                and using the ".sbi" extension. Somes examples:<br/>
                1) "ff9.cue" then "ff9.sbi"<br/>
                2) "spyro3.bin" then "spyro3.sbi",<br/>
                3) "ff8.bin.ecm" then "ff8.bin.sbi"
            </p>
            <p id="cata3.9" >3.9. Cheat Codes.
            </p>
            <p>ePSXe supports GameShark cheat codes. You can download the cheat codes from
                our server with the Download button on cheatcode option during gameplay or
                create your own file. </p>
            <p>In the second case, you can load cheat codes in the
                emulator creating a file called "sdcard/epsxe/cheats/SXXX_XXX.XX.txt
                (where SXXXX_XXX.XX is the PS-EXE name of the game, which you can see in
                exit option, or in the cheat code option during gameplay) in your sdcard.
                For example in Final Fantay 8 US-NTSC the file name is:<br/>
                <br/>
                "epsxe/cheats/SLUS_008.92.txt".<br/>
                <br/>
                ePSXe supports 256 codes per file.  The file format is:<br/>
                <br/>
                #description of cheat code 1<br/>
                XXXXXXXX YYYY<br/>
                ZZZZZZZZ AAAA<br/>
                #descripion of cheat code 2<br/>
                NNNNNNNN MMMM<br/>
                <br/>
                For example for Final Fantasy 8 US-NTSC, it could be:<br/>
                <br/>
                #Zell level 20<br/>
                800778a4 4a38<br/>
                <br/>
                Currently, only 80XXXXXX, 30XXXXXX, 50XXXXXX, 1F800XXX, D0XXXXXX, D1XXXXXX,
                D2XXXXXX, D3XXXXXX, E0XXXXXX, E1XXXXXX, E2XXXXXX, E3XXXXXX gameshark codes
                are supported, the rest will be ignored.<br/>
                You can find GameShark codes in a lot of webpages in internet, like: <br/>
                http://psxdatacenter.com<br/>
                http://www.gamegenie.com/cheats/gameshark/ps1/index.html<br/>
                After that, re-load your game, and you will be able to enable/disable the
                gameshark codes from the menu "cheat codes" on gameplay (disabled by default).
            </p>
            <p id="cata3.10" >3.10. OpenGL Plugin support.
            </p>
            <p>Starting in version 1.8.0 ePSXe supports HD graphics using the OpenGL
                plugin Peopsxgl. Because this plugin is GPL licensed, it is not distributed
                with the emulator APK, and you have to download it yourself in
                (other opengl plugin versions are not compatible with ePSXe):<br/>
                http://www.epsxe.com/files/libopenglplugin.so (for Arm)<br/>
                http://www.epsxe.com/files/libopenglplugin_intel.so (for Intel Atom)<br/>
            <p>Copy it in your sdcard, and choose it in preferences+GPUPlugin,
                and choose preferences+VideoRender+OpenGLPlugin.</p>
            <p>OpenGL Plugin works in a very different way to soft plugin. It usually
                gets better graphics than soft plugin (in 3D games), but it is less compatible
                (missing screens, or artifact), and a lot of times you have to configure it
                for every game (it includes a lot of options). An option to configure on the
                fly has been included "Toogle GLConfig", it include the next options (info
                included from the original plugin readme):
            <ul>
                <li>FS: Enable/Disable frameskip</li>
                <li>OD: Enable/Disable Off screen drawing. OD is used to detect drawings which are outside the front/backbuffer, doing such stuff in software (or by tweaking polygon coords).</li>
                <li>FI: Enable/Disable filtering. Give it a try... the real PSX doesn't support BF, so there will be some glitches if you turn BF on. Several games will look nicer... there are two main filtering modes... the Extended mode is slightly slower, but even better with most games. </li>
                <li>AM: Enable/Disable Alpha Multipass. Draws opaque texture pixels the way it should be. Of course it could be a bit slower (and if your OpenGL driver draws black rectangles around objects, turn this option off).</li>
                <li>AB: Enable/Disable Advanced Blending. Depending on your drivers OpenGL implementation using 'Advanced blending' will be nice or slow </li>
                <li>FT: Enable/Disable Framebuffer texture. To get whirling screen effects and psx motion blurring.</li>
                <li>MB: Enable/Disable Mask Bit (it usually requires restart). A really rarely used ability of the real PSX is the usage of mask bits to avoid drawing into some parts of the screen. Well, to increase compatibility you can turn the mask bit emulation on, but as far as I know only Silent Hill is really needing it. If you activate it, there are also some chances that 3D shutter glasses will work...  Another hint: because most games do not need the mask detection, you can turn it off to get more available texture vram.</li>
                <li>SAVE: Save to a file in sdcard/epsxe/config/GAME-CODE.txt the options selected.</li>
                <li>EXIT: Hide the toolbar.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Besides of the previous config options, you can edit the config file, and enable
                gamefixes. To know more about it, save the file to disk, and edit this file to read
                info about how to config it</p>
            <p>If you are a developer and and you want to do changes in the plugin the

            <p>BE CAREFUL: Some Android uncompressing tools are doing bad the job, and splits the

                get a black screen when running on the emulator (26/27Mb is NOT a right size for a PSX game).

             <p id="cata5">5.  Compatibility in ePSXe</p>
            <hr/>

            <p>Compatibility in ePSXe has been mostly tested with PAL games. Current compatibility percentage is superior to 95%.
            </p>
            <p>Some games known to work are:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>Colin McRae Rally 1 and 2
                </li><li>Crash Bandicoot 1, 2 and 3
            </li><li>Driver 1 and 2
            </li><li>Fifa 2005.
            </li><li>Final Fantasy VII, VIII and IX
            </li><li>Need For Speed I, III, IV, V
            </li><li>Ridge Racer
            </li><li>Ridge Racer type 4
            </li><li>Soulblade
            </li><li>Syphon Filter 1, 2
            </li><li>Tekken 1, 2 and 3
            </li><li>Vagrant Story
            </li><li>and many more ...
            </li></ul>
            <p>Once you start a game in ePSXe various things can occur:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>The game works correctly.
                    Solution: "Be happy !" :) Send us a screenshot when you're
                    through the game.
                </li><li>Control response is not good on touch screen in Jelly Bean.
                Solution : disable "magnification gestures".
            </li><li>The game works but you get graphics problems.
                Solution : Try the ePSXE PC version ePSXe.
            </li><li>The game works but you get 3d graphics or light problems.
                Solution:  ePSXe has a more or less complete GTE emulation, but
                several GTE opcodes are still very buggy :-(. Wait for the  next
                version. You can also try another plugin to make sure it's really
                a GTE problem (Pete's soft GPU plugin is very very compatible !)
            </li><li>The GAME still won't work.
                Solution:  If, after all, the game STILL won't work, than it's most
                propably simply not compatible with ePSXe right now. You should wait
                for the next version of the emulator.
            </li></ul>
            <p>Sound.
            </p>
            <p>   ePSXe comes only with internal Core sound version 1.8.0.
                This includes ADPCM, CDDA and XA sound.  Common problems
                with the sound:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>Sound playback is jerky or repeat.
                    Solution: You need 50/60 fps in order to get accurate sound.
                </li></ul>
            <hr/>
            <p id="cata6">6. Where can I get help with the emulator?</p>
            <hr/>
            <p>There are a number of ways to receive help. The first thing you should do is
                read the documentation, since the majority of questions are already

            <hr/>

            <ul>
                <li>(Your favorite game here) doesn't work with ePSXe?  Why not ?
                    <p>  We're sorry.  For now, try another emulator or a real playstation :).

                </li><li>I got black screen in the games.
                <p>  If you are using the hardware renderer, the number of incompatible roms is really
                    really low, surely it is problem with the rom (read 3.11 section), and get the PSX ID
                    code (SLES/SLPS/SLUS) on exit dialog, and check if it is right searching on Google.
                </p>
            </li><li>When will the next version of ePSXe be released?
                <p>  We do not know and won't tell you. Check @epsxeteam on twitter.
                </p>
            </li><li>There is repeat or jerky sound.
                <p>  ePSXe uses only sync spu emulation. So you need 50/60 frames per second to get
                    right sound.
                </p>
            </li><li>How can I hide the on screen buttons?.
                <p>  Preferences-&gt;Pad1-&gt;Pad Draw Mode-&gt;None
                    ePSXe uses only sync spu emulation. So you need 50/60 frames per second to get
                    right sound.
                </p>
            </li><li>Some games doesn't work or have graphics error using OpenGL Plugin.
                <p>  OpenGL plugin is limited in smartphone GPUs (some games or graphics effects simply
                    doesn't work or will be very slow), you can fix some graphics problems using the
                    OpenGL toolbar (read section 3.10).
                </p>
            </li><li>Where can I get the latest version of ePSXe?
